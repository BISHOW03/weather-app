## 🔑 OpenWeather API Key Setup
⚠️ Important Note: The API key in script.js is deactivated for security reasons. You must use your own API key.

To make the weather app work, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api and create a free account.

2. After signing in, navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard.

3. Create a new key (or use the default one) and copy it.

4. Open the script.js file in the project.

5. Find the line that looks like this:
  const apiKey = "c148ac0b90fb9cb4309749ab0befcd95"; 

6. Replace "c148ac0b90fb9cb4309749ab0befcd95" with your actual API key from OpenWeather.

Save the file and run the app.

✅ You’re now ready to fetch live weather data!
